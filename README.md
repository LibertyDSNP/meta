This template outlines the basic structure that README.md files across Project Liberty should generally have.
Not all components will be relevant for all work. 
Think what questions your audience might have and try to answer them in the README.md file. 

## Table of Contents (Optional)
If the README is more than a couple of pages long, help readers easily find what they need by adding a table of contents, like the following:

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Installation](#installation)
* [Dependencies/Requirements](#dependenciesrequirements)
* [Configuration](#configuration)
* [Examples](#examples)
* [Roadmap](#roadmap)
* [Support](#support)
* [Contributing](#contributing)

## Overview 
A brief description of the work and the intended audience. 

## Installation 
A concise but thorough, step-by-step installation guide, written for a someone new to the work.

## Dependencies/Requirements
List any external dependencies or requirements for running the work. For example, updates to the DSNP.org web site requires the use of the Ghost CMS, which is not managed by Project Liberty. 

## Configuration
List any useful configuration tips. 

## Examples
Share examples of how this work could be put into practice. Code examples and screenshots are helpful.

## Roadmap
If available, highlight an at-a-glance roadmap for future development. 

## Support
Direct the audience to the [Project Liberty Forums](https://forums.projectliberty.io/) or to file a GitHub Issue. If available and it's part of your workflow, include a project-specific email. 

## Contributing
We welcome contributions of code and documentation.  Please see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute.  

*(That will usually link to the project's local `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, which provides any project-specific contribution instructions and links out to the [Project Liberty global
CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/meta/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for general guidelines.  But if there are no project-specific contribution instructions, then just link directly to the [global
CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/meta/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
from here.)*

## Additional Resources
Include links to helpful resources, further reading, etc.
